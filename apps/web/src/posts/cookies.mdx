# Cookie Policy

Last updated: February 13, 2026

## 1. Introduction

This Cookie Policy explains how In2siders ("Company", "we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar storage technologies when you use our encrypted messaging platform at https://in2siders.app, our desktop application, and any related services (the "Service").

This Policy should be read together with our [Terms of Service](/tos) and [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

## 2. What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device (computer, tablet, or mobile) when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work efficiently, provide functionality, and give information to site operators.

Cookies can be:

- **First-party cookies**: Set by the website you are visiting.
- **Third-party cookies**: Set by a domain other than the one you are visiting.
- **Session cookies**: Deleted when you close your browser.
- **Persistent cookies**: Remain on your device for a set period or until manually deleted.

---

## 3. Similar Technologies

In addition to cookies, we use **Local Storage** (also known as Web Storage), a browser-based storage mechanism that allows websites to store data locally on your device. Unlike cookies, Local Storage data is not automatically sent to the server with each request.

---

## 4. Cookies We Use

We use a minimal number of cookies, **all of which are strictly necessary** for the Service to function. **We do not use any advertising, marketing, or third-party tracking cookies.**

### 4.1. First-Party Cookies

| Cookie Name | Purpose | Type | Duration | Attributes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <code>i2session</code> | **Authentication**. Contains your session identifier, which is used to authenticate your requests to our servers. This cookie is essential for staying logged in. | Persistent (first-party) | 30 days | <code>HttpOnly</code>, <code>Secure</code>, <code>SameSite=Lax</code> |
| <code>app_session</code> | **Client-side session state**. Stores session context used by the application to maintain your connection state. | Persistent (first-party) | 7 days | <code>SameSite=Lax</code>, <code>Path=/</code> |

### 4.2. Third-Party Cookies

**We do not set any third-party cookies.** No advertising networks, social media plugins, or external analytics services place cookies through our Service.

### 4.3. Cloudflare Cookies

As we use Cloudflare as our CDN and security provider, Cloudflare may set its own cookies for security and performance purposes (such as bot detection). These cookies are governed by [Cloudflare's Cookie Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/cookie-policy/). Cloudflare cookies are strictly functional and do not track you for advertising purposes.

## 5. Local Storage

We use browser Local Storage to store the following data on your device:

| Key | Purpose | Data Stored |
| --- | --- | --- |
| upk | **Private Key Storage**. Stores your PGP Private Key(s) in a compressed and base64-encoded format, mapped to your username(s). This is essential for authentication and decryption. | Compressed PGP Private Key data |
| disable-rybbit | **Analytics Opt-Out**. When set to "true", disables the self-hosted Rybbit analytics on development/localhost environments. | Boolean string |


### Important Note About Local Storage

Your **PGP Private Key** stored in Local Storage under the `upk` key is the **sole means of authenticating your identity** and decrypting your data. This data:

- **Never leaves your device** (it is not transmitted to our servers).
- Is **not** a cookie and is **not** sent with HTTP requests.
- Will be **lost** if you clear your browser's Local Storage, clear site data, or uninstall your browser without having a backup.

**We strongly recommend downloading a backup of your Private Key** when prompted during registration. If you lose this data and have no backup, you will permanently lose access to your account.

## 6. Cookie Categories and Legal Basis

Under the EU ePrivacy Directive (2002/58/EC) and its national implementations, cookies are classified as follows:

### 6.1. Strictly Necessary Cookies

All cookies and Local Storage items used by our Service are **strictly necessary** for the Service to function. They are required for:

- Authenticating your identity (`i2session`, `app_session`).
- Storing your cryptographic key material (`upk` in Local Storage).

Strictly necessary cookies **do not require your consent** under the ePrivacy Directive because the Service cannot function without them. This is consistent with **Article 5(3)** of Directive 2002/58/EC, which exempts cookies that are strictly necessary for the provision of a service explicitly requested by the user.

### 6.2. Non-Essential Cookies

**We do not use any non-essential cookies.** Specifically, we do not use:

- Analytics cookies (our analytics tool, Rybbit, is cookie-free).
- Advertising or targeting cookies.
- Social media cookies.
- Preference or functionality cookies beyond what is strictly necessary.

---

## 7. Cookie Consent

Because all cookies and storage technologies we use are **strictly necessary** for the provision of the Service, we do not display a cookie consent banner. This is in accordance with Article 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive, which permits strictly necessary cookies without prior consent.

If we ever introduce non-essential cookies in the future, we will implement an appropriate consent mechanism before deploying them.

---

## 8. Managing Cookies and Local Storage

### 8.1. Browser Settings

You can manage or delete cookies through your browser settings. Most browsers allow you to:

- View which cookies are stored.
- Delete individual cookies or all cookies.
- Block cookies from specific or all websites.
- Set preferences for first-party vs. third-party cookies.

**Warning**: Blocking or deleting our essential cookies (`i2session`, `app_session`) will log you out of the Service, and you will need to re-authenticate.

### 8.2. Clearing Local Storage

You can clear Local Storage through your browser's developer tools or site data settings.

**⚠️ Critical Warning**: Clearing Local Storage will **delete your Private Key** from your device. If you have not backed up your Private Key, you will **permanently and irrevocably lose access to your account**. There is no recovery mechanism. Before clearing site data, ensure you have a backup of your Private Key.

### 8.3. How to Manage Cookies by Browser

- **Chrome**: Settings → Privacy and Security → Cookies and other site data
- **Firefox**: Settings → Privacy & Security → Cookies and Site Data
- **Safari**: Preferences → Privacy → Manage Website Data
- **Edge**: Settings → Cookies and site permissions → Cookies and site data

## 9. Analytics

We use **Rybbit**, a self-hosted, open-source web analytics tool. Rybbit is specifically designed to be privacy-friendly:

- **No cookies** are used by Rybbit.
- **No personally identifiable information** is collected.
- **No data** is shared with third parties.
- **No cross-site tracking** occurs.
- Chat-related URLs are **masked** (e.g., `/chat/abc123` becomes `/chat/[id]`).
- Analytics are completely **disabled** on localhost and development environments.

Rybbit collects only aggregated, anonymous data such as page views, referrer information, browser type, and country (derived from IP, but IP addresses are not stored by Rybbit).

Because Rybbit does not use cookies and does not collect personal data, it does not require cookie consent under the ePrivacy Directive.
