## 5. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)

If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), we process your Personal Data under the following legal bases:

|Legal Basis|Data Processed|
|---|---|
|**Contractual Necessity** (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR)|Account data, session data, message data, group data, and attachments — all necessary to provide the Service you have agreed to use.|
|**Legitimate Interest** (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR)|IP address binding for session security; anonymous analytics to improve the Service. Our legitimate interest is balanced against your rights and does not override your fundamental rights and freedoms.|

We do not process Personal Data based on consent for core Service functionality, because no optional data is collected. If we introduce optional data collection in the future, we will seek your explicit consent.

---

## 6. How We Use Your Data

We use the data we collect exclusively for the following purposes:

1. **Providing the Service**: Creating and managing your account, delivering messages, managing Group memberships, and processing file uploads.
2. **Authentication**: Verifying your identity through PGP challenge-response authentication.
3. **Security**: Binding sessions to IP addresses to prevent unauthorized access; maintaining session integrity.
4. **Service Improvement**: Using anonymized analytics to understand usage patterns and improve the Service.
5. **Legal Compliance**: Complying with applicable laws and regulations, including responding to lawful requests from authorities.

We do **not** use your data for:

- Advertising or marketing (we do not run ads).
- Profiling or automated decision-making.
- Selling or renting to third parties.
- Training artificial intelligence or machine learning models.

## 7. Data Sharing and Third Parties

### 7.1. Third-Party Service Providers

We use a limited number of third-party services to operate the Service:

|Provider|Purpose|Data Shared|
|---|---|---|
|**Cloudflare**|CDN, DDoS protection, and reverse proxy.|IP addresses and request headers (processed in transit; Cloudflare's privacy policy applies).|
|**S3-Compatible Object Storage**|Storing file attachments and group icons.|Uploaded files (stored with private ACL; not publicly accessible).|

We do **not** use any third-party:

- Advertising networks or trackers.
- Analytics services (our analytics tool is self-hosted).
- Customer support platforms that process your data.
- Social login providers.

### 7.2. Law Enforcement and Legal Requests

We may disclose your data if required by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request. We will endeavor to notify you of such requests where legally permitted.

Due to the architecture of our Service:

- We can provide **account data** (username, public key, account status).
- We can provide **session data** (IP addresses, session timestamps).
- We can provide **message content** as stored on our servers.
- We **cannot** provide your Private Key or decrypt data encrypted with your Private Key.

### 7.3. Business Transfers

In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your Personal Data may be transferred. We will provide notice before your data is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

---

## 8. Data Storage and Security

### 8.1. Storage Location

Our servers and databases are hosted within infrastructure accessible from Spain and the European Union. File storage uses S3-compatible services. Cloudflare's network may cache or process requests through global edge servers.

### 8.2. Security Measures

We implement the following security measures:

- **PGP-based authentication**: No passwords are stored; authentication relies on public-key cryptography.
- **Session IP binding**: Sessions are invalidated if accessed from a different IP address.
- **HTTP-only, Secure cookies**: The authentication cookie cannot be accessed by client-side JavaScript and is transmitted only over HTTPS.
- **Private file storage**: All uploaded files are stored with private access controls. Access is granted through time-limited presigned URLs (1-hour expiry).
- **Encrypted group keys**: Group symmetric keys are encrypted with each member's PGP public key before storage.
- **HTTPS everywhere**: All communications between your device and our servers are encrypted via TLS.

### 8.3. Your Role in Security

The security of your account fundamentally depends on the security of your **Private Key**. You are responsible for:

- Storing your Private Key securely.
- Keeping backup copies in a safe location.
- Not sharing your Private Key with anyone.
- Securing the devices on which your Private Key is stored.

**We cannot recover your account if you lose your Private Key.** There is no password reset, email recovery, or alternative authentication method.

## 9. Data Retention

|Data|Retention Period|
|---|---|
|**Account data**|Retained until you delete your account or we terminate it.|
|**Session data**|Sessions expire after 30 days. Invalidated sessions are deleted.|
|**Messages**|Retained as long as the associated Group exists, unless individually deleted.|
|**File attachments**|Retained as long as the associated message or Group exists.|
|**Group invitation codes**|Automatically expire and are deleted after 3 days.|
|**Analytics data**|Retained in aggregate, anonymized form. No personal data is included.|

When data is deleted, we make commercially reasonable efforts to remove it from our active systems. Residual copies in backups may persist for a limited time before being overwritten.

When an account is deleted, it is replaced with a "Deleted Account" placeholder to maintain message thread integrity, but all personal information (username, public key) is disassociated.

### 10.4. Right to Restriction of Processing (Art. 18 GDPR)

You have the right to request restriction of processing of your Personal Data under certain circumstances.

You have the right to object to processing of your Personal Data based on legitimate interests. This includes the right to object to our use of analytics.

### 10.7. Right to Lodge a Complaint

## 11. International Data Transfers

Your data is primarily processed within the European Union. However, some data may transit through Cloudflare's global network for performance and security purposes. Cloudflare complies with applicable data transfer frameworks.

If data is transferred outside the EEA, we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission.
